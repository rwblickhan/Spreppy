# Spreppy

Spreppy ("spaced repetition") is an in-development iOS app for spaced repetition memorization, akin to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net).

Okay, it isn't much to look at... *yet*. But that's why we have plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/rwblickhan/Spreppy/issues) ðŸ˜‰.

## Contributing

For the time being, I won't be accepting external contributions.
I expect to do so once the design is firmed up and I start releasing to TestFlight.
In the meantime, I encourage you to fork this repository and play around!

## Developer Setup

Download the latest Xcode, clone this repo, and run `make open`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rwblickhan/Spreppy.git
cd Spreppy
make open
```
